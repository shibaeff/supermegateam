# Narrative Performance Tracker

## Introduction
Our project's main idea is helping brand owners check if their key narrative points and facts are actually showing up when people search for them. We're building on top of the peec.ai existing system that already tracks brand's visibility but not what exactly is being mentioned. 

## How It Works
What we do is take those search prompts, run them through an AI engine and check how often it mentions the specific points that brands care about. This gives marketing teams insights into whether their important messages are getting through or not. Once they know what's working and what isn't, they can tweak their website content and messaging to make sure LLMs pick up on the right information. 

Narrative Performance Tracker ensures the brand story gets told correctly when AI answers questions about the company, bridging the gap between how brand owners see their company and how AI engines actually perceive and present it to users.
