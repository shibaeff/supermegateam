## Hackathon Challenge: Build the Future of AI Search Analytics

üß© Create **anything** - services, scripts, extensions, dashboards, datasets, agents, benchmarks (go wild!) - that helps organisations **measure, analyze, or boost their visibility** in AI‚ÄëSearch.

### Why it matters

Yesterday's SEO playbook was written for blue links. Tomorrow's traffic will arrive inside the paragraph‚Äëstyle answers generated by AI assistants such as ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, and the LLMs that power smart speakers, connected cars, and AR glasses. If your brand isn't cited in those answers, your audience may never reach your site. We need new tools and tactics to understand, and improve, how content surfaces inside generative AI.

### Judging criteria

We value creativity, technical depth, and a strong focus on the user above all else. Thinking outside the box is a big plus - playing it safe or delivering exactly what's expected is not.

## OPTIONAL: Example problem spaces to explore

### **Data Collection & Scraping**

- **Browser plug‚Äëins** that collect anonymised query + click data from real users interacting with AI search.

### **Content & Site Optimisation**

- **Static‚Äësite generator plugin** that auto‚Äëinjects structured data ([Schema.org](http://schema.org/), OpenAPI, vector embeddings) to make pages LLM‚Äëfriendly.
- **On-Page improvement** application based on the findings of AI Search Optimization studies like ‚Üí [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.09735](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.09735)

### **Compliance & Standards**

- **Draft a robots.llm or ai-meta standard** so site owners can control how content is used in model training or answers (like llmstxt.org).

### **Agent Analytics**

- Analyze which bots are crawling which pages of my site
- Cluster sources into "owned", "earned", "paid", etc. and URLs into "Lystical", "Blog", ‚Ä¶

### Wildcards

Your solution doesn't need to fit into any of those predefined category - it just needs to pass one test: **Does it help organisations measure, analyze, or boost their visibility in AI‚Äëgenerated answers?** If yes, then you are inside the scope of this hackathon.
